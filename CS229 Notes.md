Patterns of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning:** Giving a data set (x,y) to find the relationship between x and y (x->y). It's a **regression** problem that y is continuous.In **classification**, y is discrete, like predicting the rate of having breast cancer...
- **Unsupervised Learning:** No labels, only a set of x.
- **Deep Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
