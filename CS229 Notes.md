<h3> Supervised Learning: </h3>

Giving a data set (x,y) to find the relationship between x and y (x->y). It's a **regression** problem that y is continuous.
In **classification**, y is discrete, like predicting the rate of having breast cancer...


<h3> Unsupervised Learning: </h3>
No labels, only a set of x.
